# beta26_Bug_is_Bae

Version Beta 3.0

Name - Bloodhive

The problem it solves : Our project aims to connect people who need blood to potential donors. We have implemented hyperlocal filtering in our application in order to show the users their nearest donors. We have a point system which gives a rating to the quality of blood of the donor and the user can filter out to get the blood of best quality. We have protection against spam by taking Aadhar card of the users and using an OCR to get information from their card. Our Android application have a sign up/ login page so that user does not have to login again and again.  Plus this is an app so there are no physical threats and hence it is easier.
